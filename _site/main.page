# WoCCode

Women of Color (WoC) – particularly Black, indigenous, and Latine
women – are the most underrepresented demographic from high paying
industries, including software engineering. Yet WoC are flush with the
talent, creativity, and social insight to solve complex problems and
lead in the software industry. This program seeks to unite minoritized
groups, particularly women of color, trans women, gender queer, and
other people of color to reduce isolation and marginalization that are
prevalent in educational institutions and industry settings. Using a
dedicated Slack space, we foster a peer mentoring network of people to
engage, receive feedback, and troubleshoot issues around participation
in open source software communities.

We host monthly 1 hour webinars, featuring code-sharing and talks by
professionals from academia and the software industry. Go to the

WoCCode is an Astropy sponsored IDE (Inclusion, Diversity, and
Empowerment) project, which receives funding support from the Moore
Foundation. Questions about the program can be directed to **WoCCode at
